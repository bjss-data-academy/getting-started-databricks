# Starting Databricks
It's always a good idea to start the app, no?

Let's open the Databricks workspace and have a look around.

## Opening the workspace
For BJSSers, we will have (*) provided a link to open in your browser.

It should look similar to this:

```text
https://adb-3123045607890123.9.azuredatabricks.net
```
Yours will have different numbers in it, but you're looking for the `azuredatabricks.net` at the end as confirmation.

Click on the link to open the workspace.

> (*) If you don't have a link, give us a nudge ...

## The initial workspace view
You will see a screen like this:
